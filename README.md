# Silverado Website

### Project Brief
This is a project for web programming in first year of RMIT. We are required to develop a webpage for 'silverado', a movie theater. The webpage is able to grab the data from another server through an api and display it within the site itself. The website will then be able to calculate the prices and post a form to the server for a check. Unfortunately, the rmit server is no longer available.
